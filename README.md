# SPARKS FOUNDATION INTERNSHIP TASKS

Hii,Everyone!

This is a collection of tasks performed by me as a part of GRIP programme- Data Science and Business Analytics Internship in MAY2021. The folowing is brief description of the given tasks:

## 1. Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML

Supervised Learning is where we are training a model with structured or labelled data. By labelled data, it is meant that the data has both input as well as output parameters.

Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

In this task, we used students dataset in which we were given the score achieved by a student along with the Study hours. Our main problem is  This is a problem which can be solved with the help of simple linear regression algorithm. We have used Simple linear regression simply due to the fact that we are given two variables i.e., Scores and No. of Study Hours.

## 2. Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML

Unsupervised Learning is where we are training a model with no label or unstructured data. Since, this dataset lacks labels, therefore the data is classified accordingly by identifying patterns, similarities and differences without any guidance from the user.

In this task, we are using the <b>"Iris"</b> Datset for classifying it into meaningful clusters. Our main problem in this task is to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. For this problem, we will be using KMeans Clustering to find the optimum no. of clusters.
